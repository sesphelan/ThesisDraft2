# FRL.XR
The unified Future Reality Lab library for XR systems in Unity.

## Install
Either download and unpack the .zip, or clone this repo directly into the `Assets` folder of your Unity project.
```bash
cd ./Assets/
git clone https://github.com/futurerealitylab/FRL.XR.git
```

## XRManager and IO: How to use

PLEASE SEE TEMPORARY HOTFIX BELOW.

Drag the `XRPlayer` prefab into your scene. Then, look at the `XRManager` Component:

![XRManager](https://github.com/futurerealitylab/FRL.XR/blob/master/Documentation/XRManager.PNG)

There are four supported SDKs: `Wave`, `OVR`, `SteamVR`, and `Daydream`. `Windows Mixed Reality` is technically supported without an SDK, but requires Windows 10 Fall Creators edition. Select the SDKs you plan on using. There will be compilation errors if you select an SDK and don't have it installed in your Unity project. Once you've selected the SDKs, change the `System` field to match the system you want to use.

## Temporary Hotfix: 
Please add the following pre-compiler definitions to your project depending on which platform(s) you are developing for:

WaveVR: `WAVE`
OVR: `OVR`
SteamVR: `STEAM_VR`
Daydream: `DAYDREAM`


If you have custom models for your controllers, you can put them under the `XRController` GameObjects found under `XRManager`.

### Receiving Input On GameObjects: Pointer vs. Global

In order for a GameObject to receive input when it is being pointed at, it needs a component which implements one of the `Pointer` interfaces, and a `Collider` component. 

In order for a GameObject to receive input globally (whenever any button is pressed), it needs a `Receiver` component and a component which implements one of the `Global` interfaces. If the `module` field of the `Receiver` component is populated with one of the `XRControllerModule` or `HMDModule` components found on the `XRHMD` and `XRController` GameObjects, that GameObject will only receive global input from that specific module. Otherwise, the GameObject will receive input from __all__ input modules.

### Interfaces and Button -> Function Call

Here is an example implementation of a GameObject receiving global and pointer inputs.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using FRL.IO;

[RequireComponent(typeof(Receiver))]
public class ExampleInput : MonoBehaviour, IPointerTriggerPressDownHandler, IGlobalTouchpadTouchHandler {

  private Renderer objectRenderer;

  void Awake() {
    objectRenderer = GetComponent<Renderer>();
  }

  private void SetColor(Color color) {
    Debug.Log("Setting Color to: " + color);
    objectRenderer.material.color = color;
  }

  public void OnPointerTriggerPressDown(XREventData eventData) {
    //This will only be called when the object is being pointed at by a controller.
    Color color = (eventData.hand == XRHand.Left ? Color.blue : Color.red);
    SetColor(color);
  }

  public void OnGlobalTouchpadTouch(XREventData eventData) {
    //This will be called whenever any touchpad is touched.
    Debug.Log("My " + eventData.hand + " hand is touching the Touchpad!");
  }
}
```

The full set of supported interfaces can be found in the `FRL/IO/Interfaces/Interfaces.cs` class.
